# RESTful-API
Representational State Transfer architecture boiler/ recourses used were stack overflow, express documentation and devEd channel 
## What I learned upon building this API

*built a schema using mongoose to add data.

*Utilized mongo DB Atlas on a running local server.

*using the dotenv package to initialize the connection string from DB

*Implemented postman as a tool in development to test the API and validate that GET and POST requests and responses are working properly.

*Utilized body-parser package to handle requested data and format the data to JSON.

*Retrieved specific posts using the req.params with a dynamic id.

*Made sure all specific route-hits were operating adequately (post, get, delete, patch)
